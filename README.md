# iVy

![A very random screenshot from a very experimental build](/resources/screenshots/experimental_build_1.png?raw=true)

Archived project. One of my first real C++ project. My first CG project. This project use tesselation, but without glmultidrawelementsindirect, because I didn't know of it at the time I coded this engine.
I'm working at recreating iVy from scratch using raytracing at https://github.com/ShinySilver/iVy_legacy_2024.
